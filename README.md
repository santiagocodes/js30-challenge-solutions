# Welcome to my #javascript30 Challenge Solutions page.

## Technologies and libraries used...

- HTML
- TailwindCSS
- Animate.css
- FontAwesome
- JavaScript
- tinyPNG

## Thing I would improve...

- Use a framework like ReactJS or Vue so as to take advantage of the use of components. I say this as there is a lot of repeated code while displaying the content area (the projects with their respective images, links, and descriptions). The footer is also repeated on all three pages. Not a big deal for such a relatively small project, but something to considere for bigger projects.
